# Project: Analyzing and Visualizing Healthcare Claims Data
# Project Overview

In this project, you we applied basic data analysis and visualization concepts on healthcare claims data to gain insights and understand patterns. The data is collected from various healthcare providers and includes information such as claim unique ID, provider number, beneficiary ID, claim type, claim dates, and diagnosis codes.
We will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, we will visualize the data to understand the distribution of various features and identify any interesting patterns or anomalies.
This project enabled us to apply and enhance our data analysis and visualization skills in a real-world context of healthcare data.
